# Fyne, 1loop's copy

Fyne v2.7.4 (BSD 3-Clause, see LICENSE), copied from the module cache
without its tests, test data and command-line tools, and wired in with a
`replace` in 1loop's go.mod. 1loop changes it where measurements show the
interface spends its time; each change is listed here, and the first commit
of this directory is the untouched upstream copy, so `git diff` against it
shows every change.

## Changes

- `driver/frametimes.go`, `internal/driver/glfw/loop.go`: `driver.FrameTimes`
  reports how long each redraw's parts take (1loop's benchmarks).
- `minsize_memo.go`, `container.go`, `widget/widget.go`,
  `internal/driver/common/canvas.go`: during the per-frame minimum-size
  pass each object's MinSize is computed once, not once per tree level.
- `internal/driver/common/structures.go`, `canvas.go` (walkTree): when the
  visible children of an object change, the render nodes after the change
  are kept (and those of hidden objects kept aside for their return)
  instead of being rebuilt, which also re-laid out their parents.
- `internal/build/migrated_notfynedo.go`: thread checks off for every build
  (the `migrated_fynedo` behaviour); they read the goroutine's stack at
  every refresh.
